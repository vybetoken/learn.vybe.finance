## Loans

Our first Dapp - vybe Loans is a cryptographically secure way to loan vybe, where every loan is guaranteed to be paid back in full.

There is no risk to any participants. When they're paid back, 1% interest is earned. This interest is burnt, directly contributing its value back to the ecosystem.

Every month, 5% of the VYBE supply is issued, and 4.75% is distributed to stakers. The remaining 0.25% funds future development to ensure the platform's long-term viability.

The staking rate will decrease over the next six months from the current 5% to the final staking rate of 2% of the VYBE supply.
